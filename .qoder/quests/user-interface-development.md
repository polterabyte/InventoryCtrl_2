# User Interface Development Design

## Overview

This design document outlines the development of core request management user interface components for the Inventory Control System. The system is built using Blazor WebAssembly with Radzen UI components, following a component-based architecture with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers.

The design focuses on creating intuitive, responsive, and performant user interfaces for managing inventory requests throughout their lifecycle, from creation to completion. All components will integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication system and maintain consistency with the current application design patterns.

## Technology Stack & Dependencies

The user interface layer leverages the following core technologies:

| Technology | Purpose | Current Version |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Blazor WebAssembly | Client-side web framework | .NET 8.0 |
| Radzen Blazor | UI component library | Latest stable |
| Blazored LocalStorage | Client-side storage | Latest stable |
| ASP.NET Core Authentication | Security layer | .NET 8.0 |
| SignalR Client | Real-time notifications | .NET 8.0 |

### Existing Infrastructure Integration

The new request management interfaces will build upon established patterns:
- Authentication via CustomAuthenticationStateProvider
- HTTP communication through intercepted HttpClient with JWT token management
- Consistent styling using Radzen Material theme
- Navigation through existing MainLayout and NavMenu components
- Error handling via centralized error management services

## Component Architecture

### Component Hierarchy Structure

The request management system follows a hierarchical component structure that promotes reusability and maintainability:

    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#f3e5f5
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
```

### Component Definitions and Responsibilities

#### Page Components
- **Request List Page**: Primary interface for browsing, filtering, and searching requests
- **Request Creation Page**: Form-based interface for creating new inventory requests
- **Request Details Page**: Comprehensive view of request information with action capabilities
- **Request Edit Page**: Modification interface with state-dependent field restrictions

#### Reusable Components
- **RequestCard**: Compact display component for list views with quick action buttons
- **RequestStatusBadge**: Visual status representation with consistent styling
- **RequestTimeline**: Interactive timeline showing request progression and history
- **ProductSelector**: Advanced product selection interface with search and validation

### Props and State Management Strategy

Component communication follows established patterns using EventCallback and cascading parameters:

| Pattern | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Property Binding | Parent-to-child data flow | `<RequestCard Request="@selectedRequest" />` |
| Event Callbacks | Child-to-parent communication | `OnStatusChange.InvokeAsync(newStatus)` |
| Cascading Values | Cross-component state | Authentication context, theme settings |
| Local State | Component-specific data | Form validation, loading indicators |

### Lifecycle Management

Components implement appropriate lifecycle methods for optimal performance:
- **OnInitializedAsync**: Initial data loading and service initialization
- **OnParametersSetAsync**: Reactive updates when parameters change
- **OnAfterRenderAsync**: DOM manipulation and JavaScript interop
- **Dispose**: Cleanup of event subscriptions and resources

## Routing & Navigation

### Route Structure

The request management module introduces the following routing structure:

| Route | Component | Purpose | Authorization |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `/requests` | Index.razor | Request list and overview | Authenticated users |
| `/requests/create` | Create.razor | New request creation | Authenticated users |
| `/requests/{id}` | Details.razor | Request details view | Request visibility permissions |
| `/requests/{id}/edit` | Edit.razor | Request modification | Edit permissions |

### Navigation Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Request List] --> B[Create Request]
    A --> C[View Details]
    C --> D[Edit Request]
    C --> E[Status Actions]
    B --> A
    D --> C
    E --> C
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#e8f5e8
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#fce4ec
    style E fill:#f1f8e9
```

### Navigation Guards and Authorization

Navigation protection ensures appropriate access control:
- Route-level authorization using `[Authorize]` attributes
- Component-level permission checks for sensitive operations
- Automatic redirection to login for unauthenticated access
- Return URL preservation for seamless user experience

## Styling Strategy

### Design System Consistency

The request management interfaces maintain visual consistency through:

#### Color Palette and Status Indicators
| Status | Color | Usage |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Draft | Gray (#757575) | Unpublished requests |
| Submitted | Blue (#2196F3) | Pending approval |
| Approved | Green (#4CAF50) | Authorized requests |
| In Progress | Orange (#FF9800) | Active processing |
| Completed | Green (#388E3C) | Finished requests |
| Cancelled/Rejected | Red (#F44336) | Terminated requests |

#### Typography and Spacing
- Consistent use of Radzen TextStyle classes
- Standardized spacing using Radzen Gap and AlignItems
